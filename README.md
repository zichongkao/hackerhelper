hackerhelper
============

Created by Zi Chong Kao, Nikolai Oreshkin and Jordan Kravitz for the 2013 Yahoo Intern Hackfest.

We built a webapp that builds webapps. In essence, it is a one stop shop for developers to build a fullstack webapp. 
They come to the website with a domain name, select which server, frameworks, apis they want, and 3 minutes later,
they walk out with a fully setup fullstack environment. Our app does all the work under the hood. 

Nikolai was responsible for design and frontend, Kao for backend, Jordan for linking up with all resources.

Kao: I entered the Hackfest not knowing any javascript/nodejs. It was an incredible experience learning on the spot
and implementing the backend.
